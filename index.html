        <h2>Introduction as a Writer</h2>
        <p class="section-kicker">How journaling, feedback, and reflection reframed the way I write.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card intro-card">
        <p>Throughout my life, I never really considered myself to be much of a writer (or a reader, for that matter). I found that STEM-based coursework was always easiest for me, so I assumed engineering was always my best fit. To some extent, I still think this is true. However, learning to develop as a writer has become one of my greatest influences. For a long time, I treated writing as assignments I had to complete and as last-minute papers that, despite putting in good effort, felt like the least enjoyable part of academia. At the same time, I usually felt confident once I finished papers in school, and though I sometimes dreaded the process, hearing positive feedback and being able to finish a paper was always one of the most rewarding feelings.</p>
        <p>It was only when I started writing for non-academic reasons that I realized how much I love writing. This past year, I went through an emotional rollercoaster of events in my life, and a friend gave me some of the best advice I have ever received: to start writing down my thoughts. I began journaling, but it often led to lists of random thoughts, and other journals led to quotes that resonated with me. I even got myself a journal with the sole intention of burning it after I finished writing through it all. Learning to write for myself became somewhat life-changing, both in the process of solidifying my thoughts and the process of reading back and internalizing my words. Even more recently, I have found this process helpful when writing for others, especially now that I am away at college. I learned how to write and send a letter to people at the start of the school year, and I have found that handwritten letters go much further than a text ever would.</p>
        <p>When I sit down to write, I have always thought that the idea of starting a paper is much worse than actually doing it. I try to follow a style in which I brainstorm, outline, brainstorm more, outline, and finally write from start to finish. In this method, I generally feel that my writing is finished after the first full draft, and I rarely do more than grammatical edits after finishing a paper. However, in this class, I was repeatedly stumped doing this and found that each project required more and more of my critical thinking. I generally consider myself to be somewhat of a perfectionist, which, for me, means I spend less time editing afterwards and more time writing original and cohesive ideas in my first draft, since my first draft is often very close to my final draft. It was difficult to follow my normal process in this class because I found myself constantly contemplating, rethinking, and revising not just my writing, but my actual thoughts on each topic and even aspects of my own life.</p>
        <p>Additionally, feedback has easily become my favorite part of writing. Of course, having someone read my work in general is meaningful, but something about receiving comments and having people see my opinions or narrative and reacting to them is the exact reason why I think most people love to write. It not only makes the next time I work on a paper more appealing, but it also feels great when I can help someone think differently or understand an aspect of my writing better just by reading it. </p>
        <p>I work by deadlines and will admit that many of these projects were completed within hours of the morning deadline. Still, I have learned that the best writing does not always happen overnight. Revisions and looking back on my ideas have often made many of my arguments completely different and more cohesive as a result. Looking back, each of these projects are easily some of my favorite things I have done this semester. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed making them.</p>
